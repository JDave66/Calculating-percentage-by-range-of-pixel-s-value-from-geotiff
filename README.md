# Calculating-percentage-by-range-of-pixel-s-value-from-geotiff
This code is developed to calculate the percentage of a specific pixel range from a geotiff file.
Sometimes a researcher wants to calculate how many pixels are in a certain range in percentage. 
This code uses the upper and lower threshold values to calculate the percentage, which shows the percentage of pixels of a given threshold color in the giotiff file. 
This code calculates the percentage of a number of geotiff files for a given range and generates the percentage value in the Excel file as per the name of the input file.
